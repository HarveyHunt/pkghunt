Pkghunt by Harvey Hunt

This is my A Level computing project written in Python 3.
The aim of this project is to create a package manager for Github source code.
The user can download and install software directly from Github. The software currently
only supports C, C++ and Python but more languages may be added in the future.

Installation:
The installation process is very simple. The user must ensure that Python 3 is already installed,
as well as xterm, QT4 and the PyQT4 bindings.

The user must navigate to the directory this file is contained in and execute the following command:

arch@arch-desktop:~$ sudo python3 setup.py install

The application will then install itself, once the dependencies have been correctly downloaded.
The application can then be launched from the command line, as such:

arch@arch-desktop:~$ pkghunt.py
